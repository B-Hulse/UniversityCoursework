To build, run the 'qmake' and then 'make'

To run, use the command './RaytracerWindow geometry texture'

Feature list:
    Geometric Intersections
    Barycentric Interpolation
    Blinn-Phong Shading
    Texture Lookup
    Shadow Rays
        Most Evident in the triangle_groundplane.obj and sphere10x10_box.obji files
    Floating point Accuracy
        All colors are stored as floats until they are printed to screen
    Impulse Reflection
        Only available on the .obji files
        Currently only supports perfect mirrors
    .obji file
        Standard obj file where each face that has impulse reflection is a line begining with i, instead of file
        e.g.: f 1/1/1 2/2/2 3/3/3 - A standard face
              i 1/1/1 2/2/2 3/3/3 - A face with impulse reflection (mirror)

Notes:
    The raytracer is slow and attempts to work in real time, so for larger files it may need to be left to render for a while.
        The render will not update unless the window is updated in some way.
    The ability to toggle the raytracer means you can adjust the scene using the openGL renderer without having to wait for the raytracer to update.
